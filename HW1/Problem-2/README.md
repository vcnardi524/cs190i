Samples pixels from gray scale images to create a noisy reconstructed image.

Sampling methods:
- Uniform random
- Strategic Sampling



FIX ME:

Currently for the strategic sampling method, for each sample the cdf vectors are reconstructed. To make the program more effecient you can calculate all of the cdf vectors once at the beginning and refer to them later in the program.
